Supplement static library whatever I need in sense of general purpose but is not directly supported from Modern C++. Or whatever reusable originated from my side projects. 

The libraty is `<sstream>`-free and uses [fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) library heavily as long as [C++20 <format>](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/format) is not there yet.
